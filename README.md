# Exploring Tutoring Database in SQL
  ## Project Overview
 
  This project holds significant meaning for me, as it represents work I genuinely enjoyed. Before transitioning to a role as a data analyst, I served as a Mathematics tutor at a respected tuition center in Dubai. It's worth noting that my passion for working with numbers was already established during that time. As a Mathematics tutor, I faced the recurring challenge of efficiently tracking and managing crucial aspects of my responsibilities. A comprehensive solution was needed to monitor the total number of sessions, understand the demographics of my students, and keep meticulous records of their lesson histories and feedback. To address these needs, I decided to embark on a data analysis project to create a database and dashboard that would provide valuable insights into my tutoring activities.

 ## Problem
 I wanted to know the total number of tutoring sessions conducted in a month, the overall count of students, and detailed demographics such as year level and curriculum. Additionally, I aimed to track the daily feedback sent to students, identify my most frequent students, and create a system to visualize the lesson history for each student.

 ## Data Sources

 To start, I created a database on Google Sheets. I organized student profiles on one sheet and lesson history on another. The student profile includes the necessary information about the students including year level, curriculum, school, exam board and following study plan. The lesson history sheet included essential details such as date, topics covered, and a checkbox indicating whether feedback was sent or pending.
