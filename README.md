# Exploring Tutoring Database in SQL
  ## Overview
 As a Math tutor, I faced a common challenge of efficiently tracking and managing crucial aspects of my job. I needed a comprehensive solution to monitor the total number of sessions, understand the demographics of my students, and keep a record of their lesson histories and feedback. To address these needs, I decided to embark on a data analysis project to create a database and dashboard that would provide valuable insights into my tutoring activities.

 ## Problem
 I wanted to know the total number of tutoring sessions conducted in a month, the overall count of students, and detailed demographics such as year level and curriculum. Additionally, I aimed to track the daily feedback sent to students, identify my most frequent students, and create a system to visualize the lesson history for each student.

 ## Data Gathering

 To start, I created a database on Google Sheets. I organized student profiles on one sheet and lesson history on another. The lesson history sheet included essential details such as date, topics covered, and a checkbox indicating whether feedback was sent or pending.
