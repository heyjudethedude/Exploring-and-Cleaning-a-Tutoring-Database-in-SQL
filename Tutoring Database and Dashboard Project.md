# Exploring and Cleaning a Tutoring Database in SQL
  ## Project Overview
 
  This project holds significant meaning for me, as it represents work I genuinely enjoyed. Before transitioning to a role as a data analyst, I served as a Mathematics tutor at a respected tuition center in Dubai. It's worth noting that my passion for working with numbers was already established during that time. As a Mathematics tutor, I faced the recurring challenge of efficiently tracking and managing crucial aspects of my responsibilities. A comprehensive solution was needed to monitor the total number of sessions, understand the demographics of my students, and keep meticulous records of their lesson histories and feedback. Aside from these, we were tasked to send feedback to at least 50% of our tutoring sessions every month and keeping track of the number of sent feedbacks was challenging.  To address these needs, I decided to embark on a data analysis project to create a database and dashboard that would provide valuable insights into my tutoring activities.

 ## Data Sources

 To start, I created a database on Google Sheets and kept record of every tutoring sessions I had with students. I organized student profiles on one sheet and lesson history on another. The student profile includes the necessary information about the students including year level, curriculum, school, exam board and following study plan. The lesson history sheet included essential details such as date, topics covered, and a checkbox indicating whether feedback was sent or pending.
 
## Tools

  Google Sheets - Data gathering
  Microsoft Excel - Data loading
  SQL Server - Data cleaning and analysis
  Tableau - Creating dashboards and reports

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
  In the inital data preparation phase, we performed the following task:
  1. Data gathering in Google sheets
  2. Data loading and inspection in Microsoft Excel
  3. Handling missing values
  4. Data cleaning, formatting and combining tables in SQL

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves exploring the dataset to answer key questions, such as:
  - What is total number of sessions in a day or in a month?
  - What is the total number of students?
  - What days are the busiest on my schedule?
  - What are the year level and curriculum of my students?
  - What is the percentage of sent feedback monthly?

## Dashboard Creation with Tableau: 
Utilizing the analyzed data, a dashboard was crafted in Tableau for visual representation, providing a comprehensive view of tutoring activities.

This project showcases the fusion of tutoring expertise with data analysis skills, offering a powerful solution to enhance tutoring efficiency and decision-making.
